The photon embedded SDK is composed of the source code needed
to command and control the camera as well as documentation on 
the functions implemented by the SDK. The documentation can be
accessed by opening the embedded SDK.chm file which is a 
compressed html help file. The communication transport layer
needs to be implemented by completing the stub functions 
contained in serstub.c.
